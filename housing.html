  <h1 id=rating-overview>How the hell are you going to rate housing options anyways?</h1>
  <p>Astute question. I'll be using three arbitrary categories: Location, Atmosphere, and Utility.</p>
  <p>Each rating category will have a rank from D to S. S indicates that it's the best (or tied for best), and D indicates that it's the worst.</p>
  <p>When it comes to <b>location</b>, closer is better. Closer to classes, the gym, the dining hall, parking lots, just about anything.
    This category is going to be different to actually accurately rate, because there's always places that are closer for some dorms but
    further for others. People will disagree the most with my ratings in this category as they're most subjective.</p>
  <p><b>Atmosphere</b> describes the overall aesthetics and feel of the dorm. Ugly is D, pretty is S. This also includes general
    cultural atmosphere and things like smell. You get the gist.</p>
  <p><b>Utility</b> describes how useful the dorm is for enhancing your productivity and giving the resident
    options to thrive. This means space, convenience, etc., all within the dorm itself (otherwise this category
    would turn into Location)</p>
  
  <h1 id=alderman-hall>Alderman Hall-style Dorms</h1>
  <p>Also known as "new dorms", these are the most recently <i>built</i> (not renovated) dorms for first-years on grounds.</p>
  <p>Residents live in doubles, meaning two residents per room, in sex-segregated floors, where there is a common bathroom 
    for all the residents of a floor.</p>
  
  <p>Advantages of new dorms:</p>
  <u1>
    <li>Closest to O-Hill Dining Hall (best breakfast on grounds) and Slaughter Gym</li>
    <li>Up to six stories high depending on the building, if you get a high floor you will probably have a nice view from your window</li>
    <li>Most modern-looking from the outside</li>
    <li>Study areas on each floor</li>
  </u1>
  <p>Disadvantages of new dorms:</p>
  <u1>
    <li>Difference in interior quality varies heavily depending on which building</li>
    <li>Ugly interior design for the hallways</li>
    <li>Hall-style bathrooms and resultant lack of in-room amenities</li>
  </u1>
  <p>I mentioned each building is different. There are a total of <b>nine</b> different buildings in new dorms,
    which all have their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
  <p>I myself live in old dorms, so my opinions might be not very informed, but I'll try to explain my ratings
    the best that I can.</p>
  
  <h2 id=balz-dobie>Balz-Dobie</h2>
  <p>This dorm is the Rodman Scholar dorm, which is consistent of the really fucking smart Engineering school kids.
    If someone says they live in Balz, you'll usually think <i>"Yeah, that makes sense"</i></p>
  <p>I stayed in this dorm for my orientation, and it wasn't amazing. The lights didn't really work,
    the interior is bland, the bed is made out of plastic and also smelled like sweat for some reason.</p>
  <p>The beds are all pretty shitty on grounds to be honest, so we can get that out of the way now. Balz
    isn't especially shit or anything for that. </p>
  <p>Balz is cool because they do cool Rodman scholar things, I've seen workshops that Rodman scholars do where they
    have fun cooking activties and such. To be perfectly honest, the only particular disadvantage of Balz is the location.
    It's quite the hike, and it's a lot of uphill.</p>

  <h2 id=woody-cauthen>Woody-Cauthen</h2>
  <p>It's amazing that I've only heard bad things about this dorm. Woody is the most least-recently renovated dorm
    in the entire campus, and Cauthen just has a reputation for being the building behind which people smoke weed.</p>
  <p>Also, the rooms are the smallest of all the dorms on grounds. Seriously. It's 15'x11'. Every other dorm is
    larger.</p>
  <p>These dorms are just overall shit. The location(s) is the only thing that isn't horrible, but Cauthen is also tucked
    away in the labyrinth of new dorms, so views are usually pretty shit.</p>
  <p>I should also clarify that Woody-Cauthen is two different buildings. Together, they have one Senior Resident,
    and they're both shit, so I lumped them together for this rating. Some buildings just have hyphenated names like
    this even if they're just one building.</p>
