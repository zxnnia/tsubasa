  <h1 id=alderman-hall>Alderman Hall-style Dorms</h1>
  <p>Also known as "new dorms", these are the most recently <i>built</i> (not renovated) dorms for first-years on grounds.
    Residents live in doubles, meaning two residents per room, in sex-segregated floors, where there is a common bathroom 
    for all the residents of a floor.</p>
  <p>Advantages of new dorms:</p>
  <u1>
    <li>Closest to O-Hill Dining Hall (best breakfast on grounds) and Slaughter Gym</li>
    <li>Up to six stories high depending on the building, if you get a high floor you will probably have a nice view from your window</li>
    <li>Most modern-looking from the outside</li>
    <li>Study areas on each floor</li>
  </u1>
  <p>Disadvantages of new dorms:</p>
  <u1>
    <li>Difference in interior quality varies heavily depending on which building</li>
    <li>Ugly interior design for the hallways</li>
    <li>Hall-style bathrooms and resultant lack of in-room amenities</li>
  </u1>
  <p>I mentioned each building is different. There are a total of <b>nine</b> different buildings in new dorms,
    which all have their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
  <p>I myself live in old dorms, so my opinions might be not very informed, but I'll try to explain my ratings
    the best that I can.</p>
  <h2 id=balz-dobie>Balz-Dobie</h2>
  <p>This dorm is the Rodman Scholar dorm, which is consistent of the really fucking smart Engineering school kids.
    If someone says they live in Balz, you'll usually think <i>"Yeah, that makes sense"</i></p>
  <p>I stayed in this dorm for my orientation, and it wasn't amazing. The lights didn't really work,
    the interior is bland, the bed is made out of plastic and also smelled like sweat for some reason.</p>
  <p>The beds are all pretty shitty on grounds to be honest, so we can get that out of the way now. Balz
    isn't especially shit or anything for that. </p>
